Because I don't have the windows pro edition I can't run docker on it. This made me install neo4j on the host machine. I couldn't get neo4j to work with the large csv files, so I'll use the small version which Helge has uploadet.

## import file
You first import the .tar.gz file from: https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2018spring-databases-teaching-material/raw/master/data/archive_graph.tar.gz.

then you unpack it with the command "tar -xzf rebol.tar.gz"
